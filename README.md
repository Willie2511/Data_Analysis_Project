# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project


This project provided a data set based on wind turbine power output and wind speed, and required us to perform simple linear regression on the data set in order to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values. Two different methods of performing simple linear regression are provided, using both numpy polyfit and sklearn linear regression, with R2 values calculated for each to assess accuracy. Best fit lines are added to a scatter plot of the original data set. 

Once the simple linear regression tasks are complete, a polynomial linear regression is created. Two different methods are provided for this task also, with both numpy polyfit and sklearn polynomial regression used. A cubic curve is created and added to the scatter plot of the original data set. Similar to the simple linear regression, R2 values are calculated for each to assess prediction accuracy. 

This project provides a combination of code cells and descriptive text to explain the process behind the creation of the prediction models and best fit lines/curves. The imported libraries used are extremely powerful in the world of data analytics and A.I, yet they are simple to use and very time efficient. Each section is clearly highlighted and organised in an easy to understand, detailed, manner.

The results from the project show that a polynomial linear regression is 15% more accurate than a simple linear regression at predicting wind turbine power output from wind speed values. 

All articles which helped shape the creation of this project are highlighted below.
